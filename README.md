# OSPAR Common Procedure Eutrophication Assessment Tool

OSPAR Common Procedure for the Identification of the Eutrophication Status of the OSPAR Maritime Area

<https://www.ospar.org/work-areas/hasec/eutrophication/common-procedure>

Assessment units are defined by OSPAR contracting parties. An assessment unit can have multiple indicators. Each indicator can have different temporal (months) and spatial (depths) coverage and reference values within the different assessment units.

Indicator results can be calculated either from raw data reported to ICES or indicator results can be reported directly. 

### Assessment Units

### Indicators

- Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN)
- Dissolved Inorganic Phosphorus (DIP)
- Chlorophyll a (CPHL)
- Oxygen Deficiency (DOXY)
- Total Nitrogen (TN)
- Total Phosphorus (TP)
- Secchi Depth (SECC)
- Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen:Dissolved Inorganic Phosphorus (DIN:DIP)
- Total Nitrogen:Total Phosphorus (TN:TP)
