<https://www.ospar.org/work-areas/hasec/eutrophication/common-procedure>

Assessment units are defined by OSPAR contracting parties. An assessment unit can have multiple indicators. Each indicator can have different temporal (months) and spatial (depths) coverage and reference values within the different assessment units

Indicator results can be calculated either from raw data reported to ICES or indicator results can be reported directly.
